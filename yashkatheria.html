                    <h3><b>Breaking: "Keep Gods Out Of Politics": Supreme Court On Tirupati Laddoo Row</b></h3>
                    <p>New Delhi: Religion and politics cannot be allowed to mix, the Supreme Court said Monday while hearing three petitions over allegations that animal fat was found in the ghee used to make the laddoos, or devotional offerings, 'fed' to the deity and given to devotees at Andhra Pradesh's Tirupati temple.
                        <br>
                        The court took a dim view of Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu's public statements on this contentious issue, particularly as his administration had already ordered an inquiry into the findings of a Gujarat lab July's report claiming fish oil, beef tallow, and lard (pig fat) were found in the ghee.
                        <br>
                        "When you (the Chief Minister) hold a Constitutional post... we expect Gods to be kept away from politics. If you had already ordered (an) investigation, what was the need to go to the press? The lab report came in July... your statement came in September. (And) the report is not at all clear..."
    
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        A bench of Justice BR Gavai and Justice KV Viswanathan was distinctly unhappy with the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister's September 20 comments, in which he hit out at his rival and predecessor, YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, over the alleged presence of animal fats in Tirupati laddoo ghee.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Mr Naidu's comments were soon echoed by members of his Telugu Desam Party and allies Jana Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party, triggering a massive political row in the southern state. The Chief Minister also proclaimed, and carried out, a 'purification' ceremony for the famous temple.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        "You ordered an SIT (special investigation team). Till the outcome (of the inquiry) what was the need to go to the press? You have been always appearing for such... this is the second time," Justice Gavai rapped the Andhra Pradesh government. His colleague asked sharply, "Unless you were sure (about the adulteration), how did you go to public? What (then) was the purpose of investigation?"
    
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The irked top court also pointed out it has not yet been established if the ghee - about which complaints over quality had been received - was, in fact, used to make the laddoos.

                    <h3>Tech Giant Launches Revolutionary AI Tool</h3>
                    <p>The firm has an 80% market share and hopes to cement its dominance.
    
                        In addition to the B200 "Blackwell" chip, its chief executive Jensen Huang detailed a new set of software tools at its annual developer conference.
                        
                        Nvidia is the third-most valuable company in the US, behind only Microsoft and Apple.
                        
                        Its shares have surged 240% over the past year and its market value touched $2tn (£1.57tn) last month.
                        
                        As Mr Huang kicked off the conference, he jokingly said, "I hope you realise this is not a concert."
                        
                        But Bob O'Donnell from Technalysis Research who was at the event told the BBC that "the buzz was in the air".

                    <h3>Economic Outlook for 2024 Shows Positive Growth</h3>
                    <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded India's gross domestic product (GDP) in the FY2024-25 by 20 basis points to 7 percent. The IMF has revised upward its forecast from the previous estimate of 6.8 percent in April.
                        The IMF's latest ‘World Economic Outlook’ report indicates that India's economic growth forecast for the current year has also been raised to 7.0 percent. The development has come in the backdrop of notable rise in consumption prospects, especially in rural areas. With this, India continues to maintain its position as the fastest-growing economy among emerging markets and developing economies.
                        “The forecast for growth in emerging markets and developing economies has been revised upward; this increase is powered by stronger activity in Asia, particularly China and India. The forecast for growth in India has also been revised upward to 7 per cent this year, reflecting carryover from upward revisions to growth in 2023 and improved prospects for private consumption, particularly in rural areas,” the IMF report stated.’
    <br>
    <br>
                        For the year 2025, the IMF projected India’s growth rate at 6.5 per cent. It attributed robustness and strength in domestic demand and a rising working-age population behind its growth projections. 
                        
                        Notably, India’s GDP expanded at 8.2 percent in 2023-24. That was higher than the 7 per cent in 2022-23, aided by a greater than expected expansion of 7.8 per cent in the fourth quarter, according to the provisional estimates of GDP growth released by the National Statistical Office (NSO).
                        
                        The Indian economy exhibits robust fundamental policies by Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which plays a key role in maintaining stability through its adept monetary policy framework. By carefully managing interest rates and liquidity, the RBI aims to control inflation while fostering sustainable economic growth. It ensures a resilient financial sector, contributing to overall economic stability.
                        
                        The resilience of Indian economy has navigated into the stock market to all time high. The record spiked stock market reflects investor confidence in India's long-term growth prospects, driven by reforms, demographic dividends, and technological advancements.
                        
                        Increased job creation, social security, SDGs & wealth creation
       <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        Higher economic growth typically correlates with increased job creation and improved social security measures. When a country's GDP grows faster, businesses tend to expand and invest more, which leads to higher demand for labor across various sectors.
                        From 2017-18 to 2021-22, India generated more than 8 crore (80 million) employment opportunities, as per the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) and the Reserve Bank of India's KLEMS data. This translates to an average of more than 2 crore (20 million) jobs created each year, despite the challenges posed by the global COVID-19 pandemic. This significant employment creation demonstrates the effectiveness of various government initiatives aimed at boosting employment across sectors.
    
                        In nutshell, higher economic growth not only boosts job creation by stimulating business activity but also provides governments with the means to enhance social security measures, contributing to a more stable and prosperous society.
                        
                        The upgraded GDP forecast paves the way for significant progress in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With a strong economic outlook projecting growth rates of 7.0% in 2024 and 6.5% in 2025, there are ample opportunities for advancing SDGs within the country. This growth trajectory aligns with initiatives focusing on gender equality, decent work, and overall economic development. Concurrently, the increased job creation and improved social security measures stemming from this economic growth contribute to a more stable and prosperous society, reflecting positive strides towards achieving sustainable development objectives. Additionally, the emphasis on boosting individual wealth creation, driven by rising wages, corporate profits, and a favorable economic environment, further underscores the potential for inclusive growth and equitable distribution of benefits.
